This approach not only reduces carbon emissions but also sequesters carbon dioxide, similar to forests. The project further integrates rooftop greenhouses, indoor farms, and green walls to produce food and further enhance carbon storage. To achieve this, the project will develop advanced materials and technologies, including a parametric Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) framework and a digital twin software, to assess and optimize the environmental impact of the proposed solutions.
