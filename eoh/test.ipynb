      "\n",
      "2. Implementation Improvements:\n",
      "Despite the lower fitness score, there are several notable improvements in the implementation:\n",
      "\n",
      "a) Added Functionality:\n",
      "- Introduced the `search_google` function implementation\n",
      "- Added proper API handling with error management\n",
      "- Included type hints and better documentation\n",
      "\n",
      "b) Structural Improvements:\n",
      "- More robust error handling with try/except blocks\n",
      "- Better code organization with helper functions\n",
      "- Added proper API connection management with connection closing in finally block\n",
      "\n",
      "c) Enhanced Search Capabilities:\n",
      "- Integration with Serper API for Google search\n",
      "- Proper handling of API responses and JSON parsing\n",
      "- Result formatting and cleaning\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there are some concerns:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The fitness decrease suggests that the evolution strategy might need adjustment\n",
      "2. The population size of 2 is very small, which limits genetic diversity\n",
      "3. Only 3 evolution steps might not be enough to see meaningful improvements\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommendations for improvement:\n",
      "1. Increase population size\n",
      "2. Run more evolution steps\n",
      "3. Adjust fitness evaluation criteria to better reflect implementation improvements\n",
      "4. Consider maintaining successful traits from higher fitness individuals\n",
