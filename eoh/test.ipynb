      "\n",
      "a) Added Functionality:\n",
      "- Introduced the `search_google` function implementation\n",
      "- Added proper API handling with error management\n",
      "- Included type hints and better documentation\n",

      "- Proper handling of API responses and JSON parsing\n",

      "3. Only 3 evolution steps might not be enough to see meaningful improvements\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommendations for improvement:\n",
      "1. Increase population size\n",
