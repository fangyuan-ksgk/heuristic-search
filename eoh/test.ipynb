      "2. Implementation Improvements:\n",
      "Despite the lower fitness score, there are several notable improvements in the implementation:\n",
      "\n",
      "a) Added Functionality:\n",
      "- Introduced the `search_google` function implementation\n",
      "- Added proper API handling with error management\n",
      "- Included type hints and better documentation\n",
      "\n",
      "b) Structural Improvements:\n",
      "- More robust error handling with try/except blocks\n",
      "- Better code organization with helper functions\n",
      "- Added proper API connection management with connection closing in finally block\n",
      "\n",
      "c) Enhanced Search Capabilities:\n",
      "- Integration with Serper API for Google search\n",
      "- Proper handling of API responses and JSON parsing\n",
      "- Result formatting and cleaning\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there are some concerns:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The fitness decrease suggests that the evolution strategy might need adjustment\n",
      "2. The population size of 2 is very small, which limits genetic diversity\n",
      "3. Only 3 evolution steps might not be enough to see meaningful improvements\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommendations for improvement:\n",
      "1. Increase population size\n",
      "2. Run more evolution steps\n",
      "3. Adjust fitness evaluation criteria to better reflect implementation improvements\n",
      "4. Consider maintaining successful traits from higher fitness individuals\n",
      "\n",
      "The current strategy has made significant implementation improvements but needs adjustment to maintain or improve fitness scores.\n",
