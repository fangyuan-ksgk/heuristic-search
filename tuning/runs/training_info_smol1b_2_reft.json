The app has been developed to create a rare market place with different services simplified to the taste of users. The software/app \n        has innovative integrations that add incremental value to customers. Users are able to easily sign on to access all food information from food management, food waste or loss reduction, including assisting users to allocate healthy food at vantage points. Also, Foodbillion has assisted advance structural infrastructure, including transport and storage systems and processing facilities, \n        and further helping to mitigate food losses. The technological application of Foodbillion will have sell or donate option of excess food or waste food. This is to enable households across the globe to sell their waste food or excess food to firms that will drive to their homes to pick the waste food or excess food to offer them payments. There \n        is also a platform where households or users can take pictures of their waste food or excess food and upload it online and auction it for firms or households who need the excess food or waste food to turn it into value to buy them. To promote increased access to healthy and sustainable foods, the Foodbillion software creates an online network where\n        urban population around the world meet biannually to deliberate on ways of addressing and advocating for communities that are experiencing issues such as hunger, social injustice, economic inequality and political under-representation. Also, the online platform has a volunteering service that enable the urban population to travel to deprived regions to learn from problems and find solutions to them.\n        For governments to promote increased access to healthy and sustainable foods, there is an online platform where townhall meetingwith urban population is made quarterly \n        to learn from their challenges and ways to address them. For  international organizations/NGOs, there is a platform where annual \n        summits are made to invite various community leaders and change agents across the world to expand on ways to solve exigent food challenges in their respective countries.\n\n        Furthermore, certain policies create food losses and waste that impede increase access to healthy food by urban population. For example, subsidies on certain food items that artificially reduce prices may be promoting increased waste. An innovative software of Foodbillion \n        helps to analyse existing programmes to determine whether they are contributing to food waste or food loss. Likewise, an \n        innovative software of Foodbillion clarifies date label terminology on food which \n       ", "```json\n{\n    \"decision\": \"No\",\n    \"comment\": \"\"\n}\n```<|im_end|>", "```json\n{\n    \"decision\": \"No\",\n    \"comment\": \"Same type of project as NXT.

The consortium has identified the need for reliable, up-to-date and easily interpretable data to be used by policymakers, scientists, and the general public.\n\nBlue Sky Analytics has developed a monitoring infrastructure called ESS (Environmental Sustainability System) with the support of ESRC and NERC. The data provides a set of key parameters that can help policymakers, organizations and researchers identify areas that need immediate action, and plan for action to address these issues.\n\nThe project will be managed by an advisory board consisting of 5 ESRC Research Fellows (representing the scientific community), 5 NERC Research Fellows (representing the civil society and policy sector), and 2 representatives from Innovate UK.
